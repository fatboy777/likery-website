  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> July 29, 2025</p>

  <p><strong>Likery</strong> is a prototype app currently under development. We take user privacy seriously and aim to be transparent about how we handle data.</p>

  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    Likery does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information to our own servers. All data used within the app, such as images or saved Pins from Pinterest, is accessed only with the userâ€™s explicit permission and displayed locally on the device.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Pinterest API Use</h2>
  <p>
    Likery uses the Pinterest API to allow users to access their saved Pins and Boards. We request the minimum scope necessary for these features and do not modify, repost, or share content outside the app.
  </p>
  <p>
    No Pinterest data is stored or cached by us. All access is ephemeral and for immediate display only.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not share, sell, or transfer any user data to third parties. This includes social platform data and any information entered by the user within the app.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    While using Likery, you may interact with external services such as Pinterest. Please refer to their privacy policies to understand how your data is handled on those platforms.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Changes to this Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy as the app evolves. Any major changes will be reflected on this page, along with an updated "Last updated" date.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Contact</h2>
  <p>
    If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:info@urbanpatch.llc">CONTACT</a>
