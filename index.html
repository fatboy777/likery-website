</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to Likery</h1>
  <p><strong>Likery</strong> is a prototype app that helps users collect, organize, and discover favorite images from multiple social platforms, including <strong>Pinterest</strong>.</p>

  <h2>🧩 What does Likery do?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Connects to Pinterest to access users' saved Pins and Boards (with permission)</li>
    <li>Displays all favorite images in one timeline-like interface</li>
    <li>Uses AI to recommend similar images based on your collection</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🔐 How we use Pinterest data</h2>
  <p>
    Likery requests only the minimum permissions necessary to display your saved Pins.<br>
    No Pinterest data is stored on our servers. We do not share or sell any user data.
  </p>
